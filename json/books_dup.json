    "summary": "“Against sane men and crazy ones, any knight-errant is obliged to return for the honor of women. A success from the moment of its publication in two parts (1605 and 1615), Don Quixote de la Mancha is probably the best novel ever written. It tells the story of a nobleman who, crazy from reading too much, travels around Spain in search of adventure, justice, and glory. The multiple interpretations of the work reflect its wealth of meaning and contents: a critique of books about chivalry, the juxtaposition of realism and idealism, and a satire of courtly dreams. With the entertaining adventures of its clever protagonist, Cervantes portrayed the complexity of being human and gave literary art its highest form of expression. This edition includes an introduction that contextualizes the work, a notes section, a timeline, and an essential bibliography, as well as several discussion and debate prompts about the reading. The work was led by Florencio Sevilla Arroyo, professor of Spanish language and literature at the Universidad Autónoma in Madrid.'",
